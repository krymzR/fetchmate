## 🎉 Hacktoberfest 2025 — Let’s build together!

I’m excited to welcome new contributors during **Hacktoberfest**!  
If you’re participating in Hacktoberfest, here’s how you can help with **fetchmate**:

### 🛠 What you can do

- Fix bugs or edge cases
- Add new features (e.g. exponential backoff, caching, timeout control)
- Improve documentation, examples, or tests
- Suggest enhancements or cleanup

### 🎯 Getting started

1. Look for issues labeled `hacktoberfest`, `good first issue`, or `help wanted`.
2. Comment on an issue to claim it (so others don’t also start).
3. Fork the repo, make your changes in a branch, add tests or docs if needed.
4. Open a Pull Request. In the PR description, mention “Hacktoberfest” if you want to count it toward the event.
5. Wait for review — I’ll try to review promptly.

### ✅ Rules reminder

- PRs should adhere to code style, include tests or documentation updates where relevant.
- Avoid trivial changes like whitespace-only or typo fixes (unless part of fixing something meaningful).
- Keep your commits clean / meaningful.

Thank you for helping grow **fetchmate**! Let’s make it better — together. 🚀
